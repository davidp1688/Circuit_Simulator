Project Name: Circuit Simulator
Author: David Peng

Description: 
Users can click on components and click to place them on a coordinate grid. 
Once the desired circuit is created, the user can click run to run analysis on the circuit.
Users can click on components on the board to see voltage levels and current going through the component.
Users can also go back into edit mode to create more circuits and change component values such as resistance and voltage.
If the circuit the user inputs does not have a "legal" output, when the user clicks on the component, there will be no 
current and voltage readings. Similarly, if the component the user clicks on is not connected to a legal circuit, 
there will be no current and voltage readings. 

How to run the project:
Run the Circuit_Simulator.py file. This will open the TopLevelApp and the user experience will be contained within
the app entirely. Simply follow the instructions given by the app. 

Libraries used: 
cmu_112_graphics.py
